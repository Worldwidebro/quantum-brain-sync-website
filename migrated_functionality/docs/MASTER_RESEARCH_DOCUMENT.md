## üß† **Consciousness-OS Architecture**

### **35-Project System Structure**

The Consciousness-OS is designed as a 35-project system that simulates consciousness-like behavior through:

1. **Memory Systems** (Vector DB, Graph DB, RAG pipeline)
2. **Agent Orchestration** (Multi-agent collaboration)
3. **Reflection Systems** (Self-critique, improvement)
4. **Goal Tracking** (Persistent objectives across sessions)
5. **Suggestive Commands** (AI proposes next best actions)
6. **Embodiment** (Connection to CLI, browsers, APIs)

### **Core Projects**

1. **System Core** - Root configs, infrastructure
2. **Memory** - Multi-layer memory system
3. **Agents** - Agent definitions and lifecycles
4. **Reflection** - Meta-cognition systems
5. **Tools** - External connections
6. **Workflows** - MCP servers, task pipelines
7. **UI** - Interfaces and dashboards
8. **Metrics** - Success measurement
9. **Deployments** - Where it runs
10. **Docs** - Documentation and knowledge base

---

## üí∞ **Idea Capture ‚Üí Monetization Pipeline**

### **5-Step Process**

1. **Capture** - All ideas flow into Apple Notes ‚Üí Obsidian ‚Üí Claude ingestion
2. **Classify** - Claude agent auto-classifies ideas by commercial potential
3. **Auto-MVP Test** - Warp workflow generates 1-page sites + landing pages
4. **Measure** - Track autonomy metrics and revenue indicators
5. **Escalate or Park** - Convert traction to SaaS or archive low-value ideas

### **Success Metrics**
- **MVPs shipped per week**: Target 1+
- **Landing page signups**: Track conversion rates
- **Agent task completion**: >90% automation
- **Revenue per idea**: Target $1k+ MRR within 60 days

## üöÄ **Billionaire-Level Prompt Library**

### **Daily Workflow (Time Blocks)**

**06:30 - Morning Market Scan**
```
MarketScan: "Summarize overnight macro, competitors, and 5 emergent opportunities relevant to [verticals]. Prioritize by estimated ARR in 90 days and probability."
```

**08:30 - Capital & Runway Check**
```
FinanceSnapshot: "Show current cash runway, highest burn hotspots, 3 quick cost reductions >$X/mo, and 2 deployment investments likely to double ARR in 6 months."
```

**10:00 - Product/Engineering Delegation**
```
EngineerDelegate: "Given product repo [repo_url] and issues X,Y,Z, produce prioritized sprint with 6 tasks, acceptance criteria, tests, CI steps."
```

**13:00 - Growth & GTM Sprint**
```
GTMPlay: "For product [A], produce a 30-day paid acquisition plan: channels, creative hooks, KPI targets, landing copy, 3 ad variants."
```

**16:00 - Deals & Partnerships**
```
DealScout: "Find 5 partnership targets for distribution with contact templates and negotiation playbook."
```

**19:00 - Reflection & Next-Day Plan**
```
DailySynthesis: "Summarize today's wins, failed assumptions, what to delegate tomorrow, and 3 question prompts for RAG to answer overnight."
```

### **Master Monetization Meta-Prompt**
```
MASTER: You are my Autonomous Monetization Orchestrator. Sources: GitHub org (Worldwidebro), Obsidian vault, Apple Notes export, embeddings_index.json, registry.json. Objectives: 1) find top 3 ideas that can be MVP'd and monetized within 14 days; 2) for each, produce runnable repo scaffold, CI, Dockerfile, deploy script, landing page, and $0-$200/mo paid acquisition plan; 3) produce 1-pager investor-ready summary + 7-day checklist; 4) update knowledge graph and tag notes. Constraints: never expose secrets, create idempotent scripts, include tests, follow coding standards, containerize with Docker, provide Warp quick-actions. Deliverables: ZIP per idea, Streamlit dashboard link, Warp commands, project_state.json update. Act like a CEO: prioritize ROI, acting only on high-probability wins, generate exact commands I can paste into terminal.
```
